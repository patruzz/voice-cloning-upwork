Hey there! Let me show you this real estate web scraper I built. It extracts property listings from major platforms, handles Cloudflare protection, and can scrape 1000 plus listings per day. Here's the scraper - uses requests and Beautiful Soup with rotating user agents to avoid blocks. And here's the result - 50 actual properties with prices, locations, URLs, all cleanly formatted. Perfect for real estate agents, investors, or data analysts who need market intel fast. Ready to customize for any site you need.
